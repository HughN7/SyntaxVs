# SyntaxVs
 
A small side project to do quick syntax comparisons

So what's the difference between using this vs just having two tabs of w3schools stuff?
- Nothing really, just a bit more convenient. They say convenience sells afterall.
- Also site has helpful info links that lead to additional resources in each table row

Rough Roadmap:
- Add More Languages
- Create new page dedicated to comparing JS/Web/UI Frameworks
